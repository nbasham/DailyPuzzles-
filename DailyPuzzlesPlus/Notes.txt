The list to choose games can have a flexible number of rows based on the list of GameDescriptors it is passed in. The rows should have spacing on the top row and inbetween all the rows below.

- All rows should be visible in the view without scrolling.
- Rows on an iPhone should range between 34 pixles in landscape to 54 pixels in portrait, on iPad 64 pixels in landscape and 72 in portrait.
